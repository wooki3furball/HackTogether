# HackTogether

Allows programmers to collaborate with other individuals to work on interesting projects
Sort of like tinder for projects where the user can like or dislike a project and according to that work with other individuals

Future implementations:
Integrating AI to create new projects and allow different people to work on them also host hackathons
Also adding a messaging section for the web application would allow people to network and communicate with each other via the platform
Another possible addition would be to make it mobile friendly
